# Keyple Java Distributed Network

## Overview

The **Keyple Distributed Network** Java library contains the common network elements used by the [Keyple Java Distributed Local](https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-java-distributed-local) and [Keyple Java Distributed Remote](https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-java-distributed-remote) libraries provided by the **Keyple Distributed** solution.

This library **should not be import explicitly** because it's imported by transitivity by the main libraries.

## User Guide & Download Information

The full documentation, including download information is available in the **Developer guides / Distributed application** section of the official Keyple website [keyple.org](https://keyple.org)

## Build the Code

The code is built with **Gradle** and is compliant with **Java 1.6** in order to be able to be used by a very large number of applications.

We welcome code contributions through merge requests.
