/**
 * API of the <b>Node</b> associated to a <b>client endpoint</b> using a <b>synchronous</b> network
 * protocol.
 *
 * <p>You must bind this kind of node on the client's side if you plan to use a Client-Server
 * communication protocol, such as standard HTTP for example.
 *
 * <p>Then, you must provide an implementation of the {@link SyncEndpointClientSpi} SPI in order to
 * be able to send requests to the server.
 *
 * <p>Keyple provides its own implementations of this interface and manages their lifecycle.<br>
 * This kind of node can be bind to a all <b>client</b> remote plugins and local services :
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code LocalServiceClient}
 *   <li>{@code RemotePluginClient}
 * </ul>
 *
 * To create it, you must only bind a <b>sync</b> node during the initialization process and you
 * never have to access it.
